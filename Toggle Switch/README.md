# Overview

This project displays a unique skillet toggle switch animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The major purpose is to demonstrate front-end programming skills and enhance online interfaces with interesting animations.

## Changes and Customizations

### 1. Initial Setup

The project starts with the fundamental setup, which includes three crucial files: `index.html`, `index.css`, and `index.js`. Each file performs a specific role in the project, combining to produce a smooth and dynamic skillet toggle switch animation. Here's a breakdown of the role of every file:

- **index.html**: This file serves as the project's backbone, organizing the webpage's content. It specifies the code for the skillet toggle switch, which includes any HTML components that will be animated or interacted with. The HTML structure's simplicity is critical for accessibility, as well as providing a solid foundation for style and interaction. This configuration guarantees that the HTML document is properly formatted, accessible, and ready for style and scripting.

- **index.css**: CSS guarantees that the toggle switch is not only visually beautiful but also easy for people to interact with. By utilizing contemporary CSS methods such as flexbox for layout and keyframe animations for dynamic effects, the switch can provide a seamless and engaging user experience. This CSS arrangement emphasizes the necessity of a responsive and visually appealing design.

- **index.js**: This JavaScript file adds interactivity to the skillet toggle switch, allowing it to react to user input. The script guarantees that when a user clicks or interacts with the switch, the associated animations are performed, and the switch responds as intended, hence improving the user experience through dynamic feedback. This JavaScript configuration adds the essential interaction, making the toggle switch both visually appealing and useful.

These three files make up the backbone of the skillet toggle switch animation project, each contributing to the structure, design, and interaction that characterize the user experience.

### 2. Centering the Animation

The animation was previously positioned in the upper left corner of the web browser, which was not visually pleasing. To improve visualization and user experience, the animation was centered on the web page. This was accomplished by modifying the CSS, especially utilizing the flexbox or CSS grid properties to center the content.

### 3. Animation Implementation

Created a custom animation to imitate the behavior of a skillet toggle switch. The style and animations were executed with CSS, while the switch's interactivity was added with JavaScript.

## Future Customization

I intend to add custom designs based on the future needs of clients or to match the appropriate project. This can be achieved through simple codes.

## Conclusion

Practice with CSS, HTML, and Java. Knowledge of components for website and integration of code into future projects.
