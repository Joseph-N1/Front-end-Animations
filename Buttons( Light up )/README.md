# Front-end Animation - Glowing Buttons

Welcome to the repository for front-end animation! This project shows how interaction and simplicity can coexist successfully in web design. It displays how even little, animated objects can significantly improve the user experience on websites and applications through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The interactive, glowing buttons that effectively engage users while also being visually compelling are the main element of this mini-project. These buttons have a glowing effect that draws attention right away when they are held down or hovered over. The goal of this straightforward yet effective interaction is to make interacting with navigational components noticeable and pleasurable.

### Visual Appeal

This project's buttons are made to glow as users interact with them, giving them instant visual feedback. This feature creates a depth effect that gives the buttons the appearance of lighting up from the interface with the use of subtle animations, colour changes, and shadows.

### Technical Challenges

Many technological difficulties arose while this project was being developed.

1. **HTML and CSS Validations**: Improving tag usage and fixing syntactic mistakes made the code less prone to errors and more efficient.
2. **CSS Animation Performance**: Careful tweaks to CSS attributes were necessary to optimise animations so they looked good and ran smoothly across a range of devices.
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: More testing and improvement were necessary to make sure the animations appeared the same in various web browsers.


### Future Applications

LFuture plans include for incorporating this glowing button feature onto other websites, especially to draw attention to crucial navigational buttons, new arrivals, and limited-time specials. This will work as a functional component to direct users towards desired actions or promotions in addition to increasing user engagement. It will also be added to the home page of applications such as the F1  ML model, and other projects such as the MonsterBet app which contains odds for nba games and live bets in real time, hence alerting you faster when there is an opportunity for a change to be implemented quickly.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates that interactive and straightforward web design is possible without sacrificing usability or style. Our goal for upcoming web development projects is to improve the user experience overall by carrying out more research and integrating these functionalities.
