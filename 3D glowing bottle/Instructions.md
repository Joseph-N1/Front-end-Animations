3D Glowing Bottle Project Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details of the "3D Glowing Bottle" web project. The project utilizes HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing 3D effect of a glowing bottle. The design is highly customizable, allowing adjustments to the bottle's dimensions and other properties.

## File Structure
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the project.
style.css: Holds all the CSS needed for styling and animations of the bottle.
## HTML Structure
The main HTML file, index.html, includes a simple structure that lays out the glowing bottle using three main div elements:
shadow: Represents the shadow cast by the bottle.
bowl: The main body of the bottle.
liquid: The contents inside the bottle.

## CSS Details
The style.css file includes styles and animations for the glowing effect, the shape of the bottle, and its contents. Keyframes are used to animate the parts of the bottle to simulate a 3D rocking motion and the glow effect.

## Adjusting Dimensions
To modify the dimensions of the bottle:

Bowl: Adjust the width and height properties of the .bowl. To maintain the rounded rectangle shape, modify the border-radius as well.
Liquid: Adjust the top, bottom, left, and right properties of the .liquid to ensure it fits appropriately within the bowl. The border-radius should also be adjusted to match the bowl's curvature.
Shadow: The shadow's width, height, and positioning (top, left, and transform properties) should be altered to reflect the new dimensions and position of the bowl.

## Important Note for Users
When adjusting the dimensions of the bowl and liquid, it is crucial to also adjust the shadow's properties to maintain visual uniformity and ensure that the shadow accurately represents the altered dimensions of the bottle.

## Conclusion
This project can be a visually striking addition to any webpage. Adjustments to the dimensions of the bottle components should be made cautiously to maintain the aesthetics and functionality of the animations. For further customizations, consider modifying the colors and animation durations in the CSS.
